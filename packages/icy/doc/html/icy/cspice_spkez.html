   CSPICE_SPKEZ returns the state (position and velocity) of a 
   target body relative to an observing body, optionally corrected 
   for light time (planetary aberration) and stellar aberration.

   For important details concerning this module's function, please refer to
   the CSPICE routine <a href="../cspice/spkez_c.html">spkez_c</a>.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>
   
   Given:
   
      targ      the scalar NAIF integer ID code for a target body
   
                The target and observer define a state vector 
                whose position component points from the observer 
                to the target.
   
      et        the scalar double precision ephemeris time, expressed 
                as seconds past J2000 TDB, at which the state of the 
                target body relative to the observer is to be computed,
                'et' refers to time at the observer's location
   
      ref       the scalar string name of the reference frame relative 
                to which the output state vector should be expressed
   
      abcorr    the scalar string name of the aberration corrections 
                to be applied to the state of the target body to account
                for one-way light time and stellar aberration
   
      obs       the scalar NAIF integer ID code for an observing body
   
   the call:
   
      <b>cspice_spkez</b>, targ, et, ref, abcorr, obs, starg, ltime
   
   returns:
   
      starg   a double precision Cartesian 6-vector representing
              the position in kilometers and velocity in
              kilometers-per-second of the target body relative 
              to the specified observer, (the first
              three components of 'starg' represent the x-, y- and 
              z-components of the target's position; the last three 
              components form the corresponding velocity vector)
   
      ltime   the scalar, double precision one-way light time between 
              the observer and target in seconds; if the target state
              is corrected for aberrations, then 'ltime' is the
              one-way light time between the observer and the light
              time corrected target location
   
              Please note, CSPICE documentation and source code 
              uniformly uses the variable name 'lt' to designate
              the light-time between an observer and target. IDL 
              uses &quot;lt&quot; as the less-than numeric comparison 
              operator and so does not allow &quot;lt&quot; as a variable name. 
              Therefore, Icy documentation uses the name 'ltime' 
              for the light-time value. 
   
   Note: NAIF recommends the use of <a href="cspice_spkezr.html">cspice_spkezr</a> over the use of

   Aberration corrections 
   ====================== 
 
   In space science or engineering applications one frequently 
   wishes to know where to point a remote sensing instrument, such 
   as an optical camera or radio antenna, in order to observe or 
   otherwise receive radiation from a target. This pointing problem 
   is complicated by the finite speed of light:  one needs to point 
   to where the target appears to be as opposed to where it actually 
   is at the epoch of observation. We use the adjectives 
   &quot;geometric,&quot; &quot;uncorrected,&quot; or &quot;true&quot; to refer to an actual 
   position or state of a target at a specified epoch. When a 
   geometric position or state vector is modified to reflect how it 
   appears to an observer, we describe that vector by any of the 
   terms &quot;apparent,&quot; &quot;corrected,&quot; &quot;aberration corrected,&quot; or &quot;light 
   time and stellar aberration corrected.&quot; The SPICE Toolkit can
   correct for two phenomena affecting the apparent location of an
   object:  one-way light time (also called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) and
   stellar aberration.

   One-way light time
   ------------------

   Correcting for one-way light time is done by computing, given an
   observer and observation epoch, where a target was when the observed
   photons departed the target's location. The vector from the
   observer to this computed target location is called a &quot;light time
   corrected&quot; vector. The light time correction depends on the motion
   of the target relative to the solar system barycenter, but it is
   independent of the velocity of the observer relative to the solar
   system barycenter. Relativistic effects such as light bending and
   gravitational delay are not accounted for in the light time
   correction performed by this routine.
 
   Stellar aberration
   ------------------

   The velocity of the observer also affects the apparent location 
   of a target:  photons arriving at the observer are subject to a 
   &quot;raindrop effect&quot; whereby their velocity relative to the observer 
   is, using a Newtonian approximation, the photons' velocity 
   relative to the solar system barycenter minus the velocity of the 
   observer relative to the solar system barycenter. This effect is 
   called &quot;stellar aberration.&quot;  Stellar aberration is independent 
   of the velocity of the target. The stellar aberration formula 
   used by this routine does not include (the much smaller)
   relativistic effects.
 
   Stellar aberration corrections are applied after light time 
   corrections:  the light time corrected target position vector is  
   used as an input to the stellar aberration correction. 
 
   When light time and stellar aberration corrections are both 
   applied to a geometric position vector, the resulting position  
   vector indicates where the target &quot;appears to be&quot; from the 
   observer's location.  
 
   As opposed to computing the apparent position of a target, one 
   may wish to compute the pointing direction required for 
   transmission of photons to the target. This also requires correction 
   of the geometric target position for the effects of light time 
   and stellar aberration, but in this case the corrections are 
   computed for radiation traveling *from* the observer to the target. 
   We will refer to this situation as the &quot;transmission&quot; case.

   The &quot;transmission&quot; light time correction yields the target's 
   location as it will be when photons emitted from the observer's 
   location at `et' arrive at the target. The transmission stellar 
   aberration correction is the inverse of the traditional stellar 
   aberration correction:  it indicates the direction in which 
   radiation should be emitted so that, using a Newtonian 
   approximation, the sum of the velocity of the radiation relative 
   to the observer and of the observer's velocity, relative to the  
   solar system barycenter, yields a velocity vector that points in  
   the direction of the light time corrected position of the target. 
  
   One may object to using the term &quot;observer&quot; in the transmission
   case, in which radiation is emitted from the observer's location.
   The terminology was retained for consistency with earlier
   documentation.
 
   Below, we indicate the aberration corrections to use for some 
   common applications: 
 
      1) Find the apparent direction of a target. This is 
         the most common case for a remote-sensing observation.
 
            Use 'LT+S' or 'CN+S': apply both light time and stellar
            aberration corrections.
 
         Note that using light time corrections alone ('LT') is 
         generally not a good way to obtain an approximation to an 
         apparent target vector:  since light time and stellar 
         aberration corrections often partially cancel each other, 
         it may be more accurate to use no correction at all than to 
         use light time alone. 
 
 
      2) Find the corrected pointing direction to radiate a signal 
         to a target. This computation is often applicable for 
         implementing communications sessions.
 
            Use 'XLT+S' or 'XCN+S': apply both light time and stellar
            aberration corrections for transmission.
 
  
      3) Compute the apparent position of a target body relative 
         to a star or other distant object.
 
            Use one of 'LT', 'CN', 'LT+S', or 'CN+S' as needed to match
            the correction applied to the position of the distant
            object. For example, if a star position is obtained from a
            catalog, the position vector may not be corrected for
            stellar aberration. In this case, to find the angular
            separation of the star and the limb of a planet, the vector
            from the observer to the planet should be corrected for
            light time but not stellar aberration.
 

      4) Obtain an uncorrected state vector derived directly from  
         data in an SPK file.
 
            Use 'NONE'. 
 

      5) Use a geometric state vector as a low-accuracy estimate 
         of the apparent state for an application where execution  
         speed is critical.
 
            Use 'NONE'. 
 
 
      6) While this routine cannot perform the relativistic 
         aberration corrections required to compute states 
         with the highest possible accuracy, it can supply the 
         geometric states required as inputs to these computations.
 
            Use 'NONE', then apply relativistic aberration 
            corrections (not available in the SPICE Toolkit). 
 
 
   Below, we discuss in more detail how the aberration corrections 
   applied by this routine are computed.      
 
      Geometric case 
      ============== 
 
      spkezr_c begins by computing the geometric position T(et) of the 
      target body relative to the solar system barycenter (SSB). 
      Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(et) gives 
      the geometric position of the target body relative to the 
      observer. The one-way light time, lt, is given by 
 
                | T(et) - O(et) | 
         lt = ------------------- 
                        c 
 
      The geometric relationship between the observer, target, and 
      solar system barycenter is as shown: 
 
 
         SSB ---&gt; O(et) 
          |      / 
          |     / 
          |    /                            
          |   /  T(et) - O(et)   
          V  V                                   
         T(et) 
 
 
      The returned state consists of the position vector 
 
         T(et) - O(et) 
 
      and a velocity obtained by taking the difference of the 
      corresponding velocities. In the geometric case, the  
      returned velocity is actually the time derivative of the  
      position. 
 
 
      Reception case 
      ============== 
 
      When any of the options &quot;LT&quot;, &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;LT+S&quot;, &quot;CN+S&quot; is selected
      for `abcorr', spkezr_c computes the position of the target body at
      epoch et-lt, where `lt' is the one-way light time. Let T(t) and
      O(t) represent the positions of the target and observer 
      relative to the solar system barycenter at time t; then `lt' is 
      the solution of the light-time equation 
 
                | T(et-lt) - O(et) | 
         lt = ------------------------                            (1) 
                         c 
 
      The ratio  
 
          | T(et) - O(et) | 
        ---------------------                                     (2) 
                  c 
 
      is used as a first approximation to `lt'; inserting (2) into the
      right hand side of the light-time equation (1) yields the
      &quot;one-iteration&quot; estimate of the one-way light time (&quot;LT&quot;).
      Repeating the process until the estimates of `lt' converge yields
      the &quot;converged Newtonian&quot; light time estimate (&quot;CN&quot;).
      
      Subtracting the geometric position of the observer O(et) gives 
      the position of the target body relative to the observer: 
      T(et-lt) - O(et). 
 
         SSB ---&gt; O(et) 
          | \     | 
          |  \    | 
          |   \   | T(et-lt) - O(et) 
          |    \  | 
          V     V V 
         T(et)  T(et-lt) 
       
      The position component of the light time corrected state  
      is the vector 
 
         T(et-lt) - O(et) 
 
      The velocity component of the light time corrected state  
      is the difference 
 
         T_vel(et-lt)*(1-d(lt)/d(et)) - O_vel(et) 
           
      where T_vel and O_vel are, respectively, the velocities of the 
      target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter at 
      the epochs et-lt and `et'.  

      If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target 
      position is rotated toward the solar system 
      barycenter-relative velocity vector of the observer. The 
      rotation is computed as follows: 
 
         Let r be the light time corrected vector from the observer 
         to the object, and v be the velocity of the observer with 
         respect to the solar system barycenter. Let w be the angle 
         between them. The aberration angle phi is given by 
 
            sin(phi) = v sin(w) / c 
 
         Let h be the vector given by the cross product 
 
            h = r X v 
 
         Rotate r by phi radians about h to obtain the apparent 
         position of the object. 
 
      When stellar aberration corrections are used, the rate of change
      of the stellar aberration correction is accounted for in the
      computation of the output velocity.
 
 
      Transmission case 
      ================== 
 
      When any of the options &quot;XLT&quot;, &quot;XCN&quot;, &quot;XLT+S&quot;, &quot;XCN+S&quot; is 
      selected, spkezr_c computes the position of the target body T at 
      epoch et+lt, where `lt' is the one-way light time. `lt' is the 
      solution of the light-time equation 
 
                | T(et+lt) - O(et) | 
         lt = ------------------------                            (3) 
                          c 
 
      Subtracting the geometric position of the observer, O(et), 
      gives the position of the target body relative to the 
      observer: T(et-lt) - O(et). 
 
                 SSB --&gt; O(et) 
                / |    *  
               /  |  *  T(et+lt) - O(et)   
              /   |*      
             /   *|     
            V  V  V      
        T(et+lt)  T(et)     
 
      The position component of the light-time corrected state  
      is the vector 
 
         T(et+lt) - O(et) 
 
      The velocity component of the light-time corrected state  
      consists of the difference 
 
         T_vel(et+lt)*(1+d(lt)/d(et)) - O_vel(et) 
           
      where T_vel and O_vel are, respectively, the velocities of the 
      target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter at 
      the epochs et+lt and `et'. 
 
      If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target 
      position is rotated away from the solar system barycenter- 
      relative velocity vector of the observer. The rotation is 
      computed as in the reception case, but the sign of the 
      rotation angle is negated. 
 
 
   Precision of light time corrections 
   =================================== 
 
      Corrections using one iteration of the light time solution 
      ---------------------------------------------------------- 
 
      When the requested aberration correction is &quot;LT&quot;, &quot;LT+S&quot;, 
      &quot;XLT&quot;, or &quot;XLT+S&quot;, only one iteration is performed in the 
      algorithm used to compute lt. 
 
      The relative error in this computation 
 
         | LT_ACTUAL - LT_COMPUTED |  /  LT_ACTUAL 
 
      is at most  
 
          (V/C)**2 
         ---------- 
          1 - (V/C) 
 
      which is well approximated by (V/C)**2, where V is the 
      velocity of the target relative to an inertial frame and C is 
      the speed of light. 
 
      For nearly all objects in the solar system V is less than 60
      km/sec. The value of C is ~300000 km/sec. Thus the
      one-iteration solution for LT has a potential relative error
      of not more than 4e-8. This is a potential light time error of
      approximately 2e-5 seconds per astronomical unit of distance
      separating the observer and target. Given the bound on V cited
      above:

         As long as the observer and target are separated by less
         than 50 astronomical units, the error in the light time
         returned using the one-iteration light time corrections is
         less than 1 millisecond.

         The magnitude of the corresponding position error, given
         the above assumptions, may be as large as (V/C)**2 * the
         distance between the observer and the uncorrected target
         position: 300 km or equivalently 6 km/AU.

      In practice, the difference between positions obtained using
      one-iteration and converged light time is usually much smaller
      than the value computed above and can be insignificant. For
      example, for the spacecraft Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and
      Mars Express, the position error for the one-iteration light
      time correction, applied to the spacecraft-to-Mars center
      vector, is at the 1 cm level.

      Comparison of results obtained using the one-iteration and
      converged light time solutions is recommended when adequacy of
      the one-iteration solution is in doubt.


      Converged corrections
      ---------------------

      When the requested aberration correction is 'CN', 'CN+S',
      'XCN', or 'XCN+S', as many iterations as are required for
      convergence are performed in the computation of LT. Usually
      the solution is found after three iterations. The relative
      error present in this case is at most

          (V/C)**4
         ----------
          1 - (V/C)

      which is well approximated by (V/C)**4.

         The precision of this computation (ignoring round-off
         error) is better than 4e-11 seconds for any pair of objects
         less than 50 AU apart, and having speed relative to the
         solar system barycenter less than 60 km/s.

         The magnitude of the corresponding position error, given
         the above assumptions, may be as large as (V/C)**4 * the
         distance between the observer and the uncorrected target
         position: 1.2 cm at 50 AU or equivalently 0.24 mm/AU.

      However, to very accurately model the light time between
      target and observer one must take into account effects due to
      general relativity. These may be as high as a few hundredths
      of a millisecond for some objects.

 
   Relativistic Corrections 
   ========================= 
 
   This routine does not attempt to perform either general or 
   special relativistic corrections in computing the various 
   aberration corrections. For many applications relativistic 
   corrections are not worth the expense of added computation 
   cycles. If however, your application requires these additional 
   corrections we suggest you consult the astronomical almanac (page 
   B36) for a discussion of how to carry out these corrections.
